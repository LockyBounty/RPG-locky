# RPG Maker

## Introduction :
Using your new super power in JavaScript and DOM, let's create a Role Playing Game in HTML, CSS and JS

### Prerequisite :
Make sure you have a good understanding of Object Oriented Programming (Class and Object) and JavaScript DOM.

### Exercice :

The exercice is to create a RPG game where the player is fighting against different monsters. He will need to use weapons and various objects to fight his enemies.

To do so, you will need to create a class Player who has :

1. a name
2. life points
3. basic attack points
4. basic defence points
5. a level
6. experience points

You will need to create a class Weapon who has :

1. a name
2. an attack point
3. a use level (meaning that the player needs to have a certain level to use it)
4. a durability (the weapon will be destroyed after a certain number of uses)

You will need to create a class Monster who has :

1. a name
2. life points
3. basic attack points
4. basic defence points
5. a level
6. a attack speed (he will attack every X second)

You will need to create a shop where the user can buy new weapons (and later items).

You'll have to use DOM to create a dynamic game that looks like a fighting stage with HTML and css.

The user can only buy items from the shop before each fight

### Bonus 
1. create a class Objects for consumable objects that have various effects on your enemy or the character (like potions)
2. give a sprite to the different element of your games like weapons and monsters. You can find an interesting exemples ["here"](https://game-icons.net/)
3. Create a system to save the game using localStorage
